Action Baker
------------

A Tool that Helps Bake Animation From Control Rig to Deform Rig using `CGDive's <https://www.youtube.com/c/CGDive/videos>`_ Workflow.  

This Feature is Made to Work Together with `Game Rig Tools <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZBx1I7vmQ0>`_ and is similar to Game Rig Tool's Action Bakery. 

While It might have other application, this tool is Specifically Made for CGDive workflow, but the Frame Ranger way.

.. note::
  The Difference between `Game Rig Tools <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZBx1I7vmQ0>`_ Action Bakery and Frame Ranger's Action Baker is that it takes advantage of the Object Action Manager in Frame Ranger For Better Action Organization.
